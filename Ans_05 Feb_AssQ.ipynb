    "#Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ans: \n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects that encapsulate properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of a certain type. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has its own unique set of attributes and can perform actions based on its class's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to help illustrate the concept of class and object:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to model a simple car in an object-oriented program. We would first define a class called \"Car\" that would specify the attributes and methods that all cars in our program should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.speed = 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def accelerate(self, speed):\n",
    "        self.speed += speed\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def brake(self, speed):\n",
    "        if self.speed > speed:\n",
    "            self.speed -= speed\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.speed = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this example, our Car class has four attributes: make, model, year, and color, as well as a speed attribute that starts at 0. It also has two methods, accelerate() and brake(), which allow the car to speed up or slow down.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new car object based on this class, we would do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022, \"blue\")\n",
    "Here, we've created a new car object called \"my_car\" that is an instance of the Car class. We've provided the make, model, year, and color attributes as arguments to the class constructor, which sets those values for our new car object. We can then call methods on our car object, like this\n",
    " \n",
    "my_car.accelerate(30)\n",
    "my_car.brake(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we've accelerated our car by 30 mph and then braked by 10 mph. The car's speed attribute has been updated accordingly.\n",

    "#Q3:Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Ans:In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the __init__() function is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes (or instance variables) with some initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() function is also called a constructor method because it constructs and initializes the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the use of the __init__() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def say_hello(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, my name is\", self.name, \"and I'm\", self.age, \"years old.\")\n",
    "In this example, we have a Person class with two instance variables, name and age. The __init__() function takes two parameters, name and age, and assigns them to the instance variables of the object using the self keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The say_hello() method is a simple method that prints out the name and age of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create objects of the Person class and pass in values for name and age as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"John\", 25)\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Jane\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "person1.say_hello()\n",
    "person2.say_hello()\n",
    "When we call the say_hello() method on person1 and person2, it will print out their names and ages as defined in the __init__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, my name is John and I'm 25 years old.\n",
    "Hello, my name is Jane and I'm 30 years old.\n",
    "So, the __init__() function is used to initialize the instance variables of an object with some initial values when it is created."

    "#Q4:Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",

This is because when we call a method on an object, the object itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method.

    "#Q5:What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Inheritance is a mechanism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called a derived or subclass) to be based on an existing class (called a base or superclass). Inheritance allows the derived class to inherit the properties and methods of the base class, and then add its own unique properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance in OOP. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class is based on a single base class. The derived class inherits all the properties and methods of the base class.\n",

    "In this example, we have a Dog class that is derived from the Animal class. The Animal class has an __init__() method that takes a name parameter and a speak() method that doesn't do anything. The Dog class overrides the speak() method to return \"Woof!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a Dog object, it will have both the name instance variable from the Animal class and the speak() method from the Dog class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-level inheritance: In multi-level inheritance, a derived class is derived from a base class that is itself derived from another base class. The derived class inherits properties and methods from all its base classes.\n",
